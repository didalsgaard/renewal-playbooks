# Renewal Playbook

This repository captures my approach to managing and closing customer renewals in B2B SaaS.

## What this is
- A practical, experience-driven guide
- Focused on risk reduction, value reinforcement, and timing

## What this is not
- A generic CS textbook
- A one-size-fits-all framework

## Topics covered
- Renewal timelines
- Risk signals
- Stakeholder alignment
- Metrics and health scoring
  
## AI Opportunities in Customer Success

This workflow is currently managed through a combination of CRM data, product usage signals, and human judgment.

Potential AI-supported enhancements:
- Auto-summarization of account health for QBRs and exec reviews
- Early churn-risk detection based on changes in usage, support tickets, and stakeholder engagement
- Draft renewal and expansion narratives using historical account data
- Prioritization of CS focus based on predicted revenue impact

AI here is intended to **augment CS judgment**, not replace relationship ownership.
