# Case Study: Turning a Red Renewal into Expansion (Mid-Market MarTech)

## Context
- **Vendor:** B2B SaaS MarTech platform (license-based)
- **Customer:** Mid-market travel & experience booking company
- **Contract Value:** $75K ARR at entry
- **Term:** Annual at start, renewed as multi-year
- **Product Scope:** Full product suite purchased at point of sale
- **Primary Contact:** Head of CRM
- **Economic Buyer / Signer:** CEO

At renewal, the customer had not fully gone live on the purchased product suite. Several channels were deactivated, overall usage was low, and competitor alternatives were actively being evaluated. Executive focus was primarily on cost reduction.

## Risk Signals (T-120 → T-90)
- 🔴 Low usage relative to licensed footprint  
- 🔴 Inactive channels creating perceived shelfware risk  
- 🔴 Disengaged executive sponsor (CEO)  
- 🔴 Cost-reduction narrative dominating renewal conversations  
- 🔴 Competitive noise positioning lower-cost alternatives  
- 🔴 Account health rated **Red** at both T-120 and T-90

## Renewal Strategy (Hybrid CS + AM)
Rather than treating this as a save or pricing-led renewal, I reframed the motion as a **value reset paired with commercial restructuring**.

Key actions:
- Reset success criteria around **CRM-owned outcomes**, not full-suite adoption
- De-scoped inactive channels from the renewal narrative to reduce friction and rebuild trust
- Repositioned value around **repeat bookings, lifecycle engagement, and near-term revenue impact**
- Balanced stakeholder dynamics by:
  - Empowering the Head of CRM to own execution and value proof
  - Addressing CEO concerns through cost predictability and risk mitigation rather than discounting

This approach combined:
- **CS discipline:** adoption recovery, enablement, and value realization
- **AM rigor:** scope control, deal structure, and executive alignment

---

## Turning Point
At approximately **T-45**, a reset conversation clarified:
- What was live versus aspirational
- What the CRM team could realistically operationalise in the next 90 days
- How success would be measured post-renewal

This shifted the conversation from *“should we reduce spend?”* to  
*“how do we maximise value from what we’ve already committed to?”*

Latent demand for CRM-aligned capabilities resurfaced once scope and ownership were clarified.

---

## Commercial Outcome
- **Result:** Renewal + expansion
- **Structure:**
  - Expansion of CRM-aligned capabilities
  - Commitment to a **multi-year agreement**
- **Commercials:**
  - New payment terms negotiated in exchange for term commitment
  - **No license discounting**
- **Value Support:**
  - Additional enablement and value-realisation support agreed to accelerate adoption
- **Signer:** CEO (same economic buyer), with Head of CRM driving day-to-day ownership

---

## Why This Worked
- Executive cost pressure was addressed through **deal structure**, not price
- De-scoping reduced perceived waste without reducing strategic value
- Multi-year commitment created space for adoption to catch up to ambition
- Expansion was positioned as a **stability and value play**, not an upsell

---

## Retrospective

### What Worked
- Using payment terms as leverage instead of discounting
- Re-anchoring renewal ownership with the operational leader
- Pairing commercial changes with concrete enablement commitments

### What I’d Do Earlier
- Escalate executive disengagement sooner as a renewal risk
- Set phased adoption expectations at point of sale

### Playbook Takeaway
> In red renewals driven by under-adoption, structure beats discounting.  
> Multi-year commitments paired with enablement often unlock both renewal and expansion.
